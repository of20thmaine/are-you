<h1 align="center">Are You?</h1>

<br>

Are You may be the most annoying way to increase productivity ever devised. If you, like me, suffer from only having occasional feelings of inadequacy, then Are You is the app for you- make what was once occasional a constant in your working life! Are You seeks to prove that making meaningful life changes is replaceable with technology.

## The Idea:

People who practice mindfulness for as little as ten minutes daily may realize significant benefits almost immediately. One such benefit is the ability to notice when your thoughts run astray and to capitalize on that realization by giving you the power to guide your stream of consciousness back under control gently. And so I ask- why restrain such benefits to those willing to put in the work to achieve them? Why not allow everyone to notice when their thoughts are astray without hard work?

The Are You method is simple; it only requires downloading, installing, and running the app. Then, at a user-selectable interval (I recommend 15 minutes), the app will show a message to you asking you if you're on track. Or any message you'd like. You can then make the window rescind back to its home in the system tray by closing the window or pressing any key on your keyboard- and voila, you're back on your way to being on track!
